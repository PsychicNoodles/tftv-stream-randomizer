tftv-stream-randomizer
======================

A simple PHP program that randomly selects a live stream listed on TFTV and redirects to it. It uses [tftv-api](http://tftv-api.herokuapp.com) to load the current streams and randomly selects from the list.

The TFTV logo and background image is ~~stolen~~borrowed from http://teamfortress.tv, the website this project is targeted toward, so make sure to check them out. They are used without permission but with no commercial intent.
